# 5. EVIDENCE, VERIFIABILITY & NON-OPINION

Aureum One produces evidence, not assertions.

## 5.1 What Constitutes Evidence

- Custody attestations
- Event timestamps
- Reconciliation states
- Authorization logs

All evidence is:

- append-only
- source-bound
- non-interpretive

## 5.2 What the System Never States

The system does not state:

- "assets are sufficient"
- "custody is safe"
- "no fraud exists"
- "risk is acceptable"

Any such conclusion is external interpretation.

## 5.3 Optional External Review

Third-party review is permitted but:

- read-only
- non-binding
- non-substitutive

External opinion does not alter system truth.
