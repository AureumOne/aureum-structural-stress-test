# 6. OPEN STRUCTURAL QUESTIONS

The following are conscious design trade-offs, not omissions:

- Whether additional independent custody attestations add value or noise.
- Whether governance thresholds should be static or adaptive.
- Whether reconciliation frequency should be continuous or batched.
- Jurisdictional enforceability variance across operating regions.

These questions are intentionally left open.
