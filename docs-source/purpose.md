# 1. PURPOSE & READING CONTRACT

This document exists to be attacked at the architectural level.

It is not a pitch, not a proposal, not an endorsement request and not a validation exercise. It does not seek agreement, approval or comfort.

A correct identification of "no critical breakpoint" is itself a valid outcome.

The sole purpose of this material is to expose the architectural structure of Aureum One to adversarial scrutiny, with emphasis on:

- failure modes
- governance boundaries
- evidence integrity
- responsibility limits

This document assumes the reader is capable of identifying structural weaknesses without guidance.

---

## If you are looking for:

- commercial rationale
- business upside
- regulatory positioning
- stakeholder narratives

This document is not intended for you.
